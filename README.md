Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The total stock volume of the stock. Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

A list of stock with their unique labels (tickers) with the corresponding dates. The stock came with their values from open to close along with the volume of the stock. 
The script created analyzes the quarterly change for every ticker, the percentage change within the quarterly change and the total volume for that stock.
To summarize the stocks we found the ones with the greatest increase, and lowest increase to show the most/least succesful.
